        Nepalaya College is the name which will most probably be never omitted from the memory of my mind as whatever skills and platform were needed for the personal, academic and social development, were aptly offered to me by my respected teachers at this institution. In fact, I find no word sufficient to express my true respect to this college for everything it has done. Thank vou, Nepalaya.
